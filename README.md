# Sensors-in-Formula1
 We have access to a system that allows to record the speed of a F1 car. The measurements are collected by two high-precision sensors that sample the speed every second. Each sensor stores their measurements in its own separate CSV file. This program reads and processes this data (in parallel) to output a summary of it.
